Always check and respect these guidelines, as ignoring them may violate the website's terms of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Abide by __Terms of Service:__ Many websites have terms of service (ToS) that explicitly prohibit or restrict web scraping. Violating these terms could lead to legal consequences, including being banned from the site or facing litigation. It's important to read and understand a site's ToS before scraping.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Respect __Copyright and Intellectual Property:__ Scraping copyrighted content (such as articles, images, or databases) without permission could be a violation of intellectual property laws. Always ensure you are scraping publicly available data or data that you have explicit permission to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Data Privacy:__ Avoid scraping personal or sensitive information.\n",
